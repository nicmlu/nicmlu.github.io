Moss Gold developed out of my own entrepreneural spirits. My husband and I, avid seamoss users, decided to venture out and open a store selling a variety of products made from seamoss. Often times, the hardest part about developing your project is coming up with the idea. Luckily for me, inspiration struck close to home. 

To meet the requirements of the project, my Single Page Applications (APS) must include: 
1. an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend with at least one has-many relationship, 
2. Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior, 
3. at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
